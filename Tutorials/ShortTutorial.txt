-Download and install Github Desktop
-Open the Github Shell and wait for it to load
-Navigate to your directory in which you wish to setup your local repository
-These would be the normal commands to setup the git initially:
	1. git init
	2. echo "test document">>test_doc.txt
	3. git add test_doc.txt
	4. git commit -m "First commmit"
	5. git remote add origin https://github.com/oparra22/seniod-design.git
	6. git push -u origin master

- But since I have already pushed to Github, You will just need to do steps 1 and 5 and then this additional step:
	7. git pull origin master
-This should pull the data to your local repository before you make any changes so that you have the most up to date repository

Note:I will also be uploading the official tutorial from our Software Engineering Course.


DO NOT FORGET TO WRITE A MEANINGFUL COMMIT MESSAGE BEFORE YOU PUSH TO THE MASTER!!

To add all changed items to be committed type the following command:
git add --all
otherwise you can add individual files by replacing "--all" with a filename or directory
